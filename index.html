Yes, we'll be doing some work in your area, and would like to schedule a time we can come by to give you the free normal measuring for the estimate, and we have some excellent promotion and discounts available. Will you be available tomorrow? No we're not, I'll be over for that, I said maybe next week some time, so hold on one second, I'll schedule.

I can do, yeah, I can put in there for you for 12, let me move this in here forward for you first, just to reiterate the address, and just let me know if I'm wrong.
